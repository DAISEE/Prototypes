_(documentation in progress)_

For this version of this version of the prototype, we have:  
* a Raspberry Pi connected to a battery (= "Node 1" = "consumer"). This node is monitored by an ACS712-based sensor and a LiPo Fuel Gauge.
* a Raspberry Pi connected to a solar panel and a battery (= "Node 2" = "producer"). This node is monitored by an INA219 sensor.
* a Raspberry Pi controlling a relay, allowing to switch the energy source.

![](https://framapic.org/9pUcq6JiUuC2/bnaoZUVbDFBW)

On each node (_consumer_ and _producer_), the CitizenWatt application, an Ethereum client and the Daisee application are running (see the previous instructions, pages 2 and 3).  
In order to allow for energy exchange, additional python scripts are required:  
➡  https://github.com/DAISEE/Scripts  

## Installation
Clone the repository on each Raspberry Pi:  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DAISEE/Scripts.git
```

### Relay

* After connecting the relay to the Raspberry Pi (see the tutorial on [Sunfounder Wiki](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=4-Channel_High_Level_Trigger_Relay)), connect the node 1 energy source to the first channel (= _channel 0_) and the node 2 energy source to the second channel (= _channel 1_).

* Install [RPI.GPIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO) library:  
```bash
$ pip3 install RPi.GPIO pyyaml
```

* Run the following script:
```bash
$ python3 scripts/server_relay.py
```

The others nodes can interact with the relay through sockets (port: 15555).  

### Producer and consumer nodes

* To interact with the Ethereum blockchain, the [web3.py](https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py) library, a python implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), is used.
```bash
$ pip3 install web3
```

* create the parameter file (`parameters.yml`) from the example and complete it:

|Type|Field|Description|

  host: '192.168.0.50'
  port: 15555
```

## Running scripts

The script `client_interaction.py` allows to update energy data on the Blockchain from data exposed by CitizenWatt API and triggers energy exchanges.

### Producer node

Just run the script:
```bash
$ python3 scripts/client_interaction.py
```

The transactions are displayed on the DAISEE App:  
![](https://framapic.org/rF3y8mDMoZ4Q/uCZHjaCo94IA)

### Consumer node

* To allow energy exchange, the consumer has to have some tokens.  
If not, transfer some tokens via the Parity UI (function `Transfer` of the **Token contract**):
![](https://framapic.org/HSIcaFMcgXVn/lUrcBqZ5RbQm)

* Moreover, it is necessary that the Daisee contract can transfer these token to the energy producer at the time of the purchase.
    * Function `Approve` of the **Token contract**:
    ![](https://framapic.org/GmxTjN9DwEia/lQnO3vclZ583)
    * After validation of the transaction, the allowance is updated:
    ![](https://framapic.org/kTeeaMa8GdLb/1kZGz148eEdH)

> Note: to avoid to update the allowance before buying energy, the token contract offers the function `approveAndCall`. This function is not yet used in this version of the prototype.

* Data displayed on the DAISEE App
![](https://framapic.org/ru5JoG3AtcEa/Xo6IEXgTNcJo)

* Run the script
```bash
$ python3 scripts/client_interaction.py
```

* Data displayed on the DAISEE App after running the script:
![](https://framapic.org/bAODSPWiZYlw/GjvIEtrWKPIf)
> As long as the battery charge is greater than the threshold, Node 1 consumes the energy of its own battery (blocks 728 to 731).  
> Once the battery charge has fallen below the threshold, Node 1 buys energy (block 732) and consumes power from Node 2 battery (blocks 733 to 735).  
> The table "**Purchased energy**" shows the energy consumed compared to the energy purchased.
